EXPLAIN IN DETAIL ABOUT JDK, JVM, AND JRE?
JDK (Java Development Kit):
The Java Development Kit is a software package provided by Oracle that includes everything needed for developing, compiling, and running Java applications. 
It consists of various tools, exe cutables, libraries, and documentation. 
Here are its key components:
Compiler (javac): The compiler in the JDK translates Java source code into bytecode, which is the intermediate form of code that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Debugger: The JDK provides a debugger tool (jdb) that allows developers to debug their Java code by setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and stepping through code.
Java Runtime Environment (JRE): The JDK includes a JRE, which is needed for running Java applications on your local machine during development and testing.
JavaFX and other Libraries: The JDK includes various libraries, including JavaFX for building graphical user interfaces and other standard libraries for common programming tasks.
Java Documentation: The JDK provides comprehensive documentation for the Java standard libraries, APIs, and tools.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): The Java Runtime Environment is a subset of the JDK and is necessary for running Java applications on end-user machines. 
It includes the JVM, class libraries, and other necessary runtime components. 
Key points about JRE:
Runtime Environment: JRE provides the environment required to execute Java applications. It includes the JVM that interprets and runs bytecode.
No Development Tools: Unlike the JDK, the JRE doesn't include development tools like compilers and debuggers. It's designed purely for running Java applications.
Distribution: When you distribute a Java application to users, they need to have a compatible JRE installed on their system to run the application.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The Java Virtual Machine is a crucial component of the Java platform. It's an abstract machine that provides an execution environment for Java bytecode. 
JVMs are available for various operating systems, and they enable Java programs to be platform independent. 
Key points about JVM:
Bytecode Execution: JVM executes Java bytecode, which is generated by compiling Java source code. This bytecode is an intermediate form that is architecture-neutral and can be executed on any system with a compatible JVM.
Memory Management: JVM manages memory allocation and garbage collection. It automatically deallocates memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable, thus helping to prevent memory leaks.
Platform Independence: One of the primary benefits of Java is its "write once, run anywhere" capability. Different JVM implementations allow Java applications to run on various operating systems without modification.
Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT): Some JVMs use JIT compilation, which translates bytecode into native machine code at runtime. This can lead to performance improvements by optimizing the execution of frequently used code paths.

In summary:
JDK is for developers and includes everything needed to develop, compile, and run Java applications.
JRE is a subset of the JDK and is required to run Java applications on end-user machines.
JVM is the runtime environment that executes Java bytecode, making Java applications platform-independent.
